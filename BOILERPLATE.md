# AI SaaS Boilerplate

This repository now includes a script to generate a trimmed boilerplate for building AI SaaS apps.
The boilerplate includes:

- Next.js + TypeScript setup
- Authentication via better-auth with social providers
- Usage based subscription helpers and billing checkout
- Rate-limited AI example endpoint using Upstash and Google AI SDK
- Basic UI shell with Tailwind and shadcn/ui

## Usage

```bash
npm run create-boilerplate
```

A new `boilerplate` directory will be created containing the starter kit with theme-specific code removed.
Use it as the foundation for your own AI SaaS application.
